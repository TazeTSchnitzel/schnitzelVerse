Ohey. schnitzelVerse is STILL ONLINE.<br>
<a href=index2.html>You can go to it here.</a><br>
But this post is about the fact it might not be for much longer.<br>
<br>
<p>So yeah, ajf here.
<p>schnitzelVerse and ponyplace are completely unmaintainable. schnitzelVerse being even worse than ponyplace, and I simply don't know what to do. I have exams coming up, I desperately need to study, and while I'd love to spend lots of time fixing stuff with sV, I can't. And that's not the only thing bothering me just now. I need to get out more.
<p>So somehow, someday, I need to either hand over control of both projects to someone who can host and maintain them, or kill them off. I'm sorry about this, but that's how it has to be. I just can't keep up with maintaining them now.<br>
<p>schnitzelVerse is crashing too often, and I have to fix the bugs each time, and it's not fun. So next time it goes down, I can't guarantee it will come back up. Sorry.
