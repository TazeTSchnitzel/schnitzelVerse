Hey, ajf here.<br>
The old ponyplace and schnitzelVerse are dead.<br>
But ponyplace lives on in Worlize. You can find it here:<br>
<a href="https://www.worlize.com/ponyplace" style="font-size: 16pt;">https://www.worlize.com/ponyplace</a><br>
(I'm TazeTSchnitzel there)<br>
<br>
If you want the old ponyplace avatars and backgrounds, you can find them here: <a href="http://ponyplace.ajf.me/media/">http://ponyplace.ajf.me/media/</a> - you can upload them to Worlize and they will work fine. So please do that.
