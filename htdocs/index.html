<title>schnitzelVerse</title>

Hey, ajf here. I'm really sorry about this, but I can no longer maintain schnitzelVerse or ponyplace.<br>
They are both dead, forever, and I'm sorry about that.<br>
But the good news is there is a much older site that was quite like both, that works very well, that is by a friend of mine.<br>
It is called <b>Worlize</b>. It is much easier to use than schnitzelVerse, it never goes down and it has some things schnitzelVerse doesn't, like animated GIF avatars.<br>
<br>
I'm recreating ponyplace in Worlize. You can find it here:<br>
<a href="https://www.worlize.com/ponyplace" style="font-size: 16pt;">https://www.worlize.com/ponyplace</a><br>
<br>
If you want the old ponyplace avatars and backgrounds, you can find them here: <a href="http://ponyplace.ajf.me/media/">http://ponyplace.ajf.me/media/</a> - you can upload them to Worlize and they will work fine. So please do that.
